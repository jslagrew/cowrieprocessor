# cowrieprocessor
This project is still supported, but not being developed for new features. Check out the following repository for the next generation of this tool with many more features:

https://github.com/datagen24/cowrieprocessor

The initial purpose of this application is helps simplify command input and file download data from DShield Honeypots (https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield). This Python applications is designed to process and summarize Cowrie logs (https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie).

**Prerequisites**

The script requires the Dropbox python module to be installed, even if not being used. To install the necessary module(s):

```
sudo apt-get install python3-dropbox
```

**Using the script - arguments**

By default, the script will look for any Cowrie JSON logs in the /srv/cowrie/var/log/cowrie path (current default for DShield honeypot if setting is enabled to locally store these files). At least one argument to search for relevant data is needed and all other arguments are optional, but may allow for additional data enrichment. 

- Required Search Term (one required)
  - --download <hash / file name) --> hash of file downloaded or otherwise created by honeypot (matches file download names in /srv/cowrie/var/lib/cowrie/downloads)
  - --ttyfile <file name> --> file name of a tty file in /srv/cowrie/var/lib/cowrie/tty/
  - --session <cowrie session number> --> session number that ties cowrie logs for a session together (found in logs)
  - --summarizedays <number of days> --> Outline all attacks and summarize for period of days specified. For example, a value of '1' will reivew only attacks from teh current day. 
    - This will create two different report text files within the destination folder. One will be the summary for every attack seen in that time period. Another file will contain only attacks that appeared more unique (low or absent virustotal hit count for malware or less than 5 instances of attacks comprised of the same number of commands executed during the attack.  
- Optional Search Term
  - --vtapi <VT API Key> --> VirusTotal API Key to enrich data with VT (will also download a local copy in working path with full JSON output)
  - --email <email address> --> Your email address, which will be used to register query with DShield when querying for additional IP address data
  - --logpath <path to cowrie JSON logs> --> Enter an alernate path where cowrie logs may be stored
  - --dbxapi <Dropbox API Key> --> If included, summary data text reports will be uploaded to Dropbox account within 'cowriesummaries' folder
  - --dbxkey <Dropbox access token> --> short-lived API access key for Dropbox account
  - --dbxsecret <Dropbox access secret> --> secret used with associated short-lived API access key
  - --dbxrefreshtoken <Dropbox refresh token> --> refresh token used to get new short-lived API access key
  - --spurapi <SPUR.us API key> --> If included, IP address data will be enriched with SPUR.us data for summary, upload and download data

**Locally created files**

(script working path)/cowrieprocessor.sqlite - SQLite database with attack summary data that's been processed
  
(script working path)/\<datetime processor run\>_\<summary request\>_report.txt - summary of all attacks during requested timespan
  
(script working path)/\<datetime processor run\>\_abnormal\_\<summary request\>_report.txt - summary of unusual attacks during requested timespan
  
(script working path)/\<datetime processor run\>/(filehash) - VirusTotal results for filehash in JSON format (searhed by file hash)

(script working path)/\<datetime processor run\>/uh_(ipaddress) - URLhaus locally cached lookup results in JSON format (searched by IP)

(script working path)/\<datetime processor run\>/files_(filehash) - VirusTotal response for files uploaded to VirusTotal

This data is currently stored for troubleshooting and potential analysis in the future. Not all data received from URLHaus or VirusTotal is found in the summarized data and this raw JSON data can be reviewed for additional context. 
  
**Abnormal/unusual Attack Reports**

When performing summary reviews of data, the script will also try to summarize the attacks and highlight any attack sessions that meet the following criteria
  - Unusual number of commands (when comparing against other attacks during the summary time period)
  - Malware submitted that is a recent additional to VirusTotal

**Dropbox Upload**

Uploading to Dropbox required creating a Dropbox app associated with an account. Additional information on how to do this can be found within [Dropbox documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started#app%20console).
